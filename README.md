Context:
We are seeking help and organizing a fully capable community consisting of individuals and startups to produce this “Low-Cost PPE of Head Region for Low-Income People” by using local resources to protect local emergency support workers, laborers, volunteers and individuals for an emergency response to the pandemic.

We are capable of satisfying very short-term emergency needs through volunteering community contribution and securing long term supply through industrial production backed by government or non - government funding structure.
