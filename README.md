Background of the Project:
The world is facing a global crisis posed by coronavirus.The COVID-19 pandemic has swept over the world in a geometric progression. And third world countries like Bangladesh are absolutely not prepared for it. They don't even have enough personal protective equipment to save the health care staff and doctors. So the doctors and medical staff are unwilling to give service to covid-19 patients and other patients. Lack of PPE for the marginal mass living below poverty line is making them exposed to life threat by eliminating their food supply in this lockdown affected jobless situation. 

Rationale of the Project:
The pandemic is highly contagious in nature. Stopping it early may make it possible to restrain its widespread contamination. As there are no known working vaccines against this virus, to prevent it from spreading would be the best strategy.

But to control it’s spreading we need to ensure enough supply of preventive equipment among the general mass. But Bangladesh being a third world country couldn’t ensure enough supply within its current financial state. So external support is highly demanded.

The world is implementing a lockdown strategy to restrain COVID-19 spreading which poses a great threat to the financially crippled mass of Bangladesh. Daily earning is their only means of ensuring food safety. In this situation they may starve let alone enjoy proper treatment if affected by the virus. 

So the necessity of a properly working low cost PPE solution can be summarized as below:
General mass & marginal health care units can’t afford the current high cost PPE solutions.
If the marginal general mass can’t be protected, they will be unable to earn daily living and would starve.
Distant health care units will come to a halt and normal patients will be deprived of health services.
Our country can’t afford to supply PPE to her entire population.

Context:
We are seeking help and organizing a fully capable community consisting of individuals and startups to produce this “Affordable PPE of Head Region for Low-Income People” by using local resources to protect local emergency support workers, laborers, volunteers and individuals for an emergency response to the pandemic.

We are capable of satisfying very short-term emergency needs through volunteering community contribution and securing long term supply through industrial production backed by government or non - government funding structure.
